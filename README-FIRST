Note: I discovered that the repository https://github.com/gnuless/ncc.git had been deleted. After some searching, I found another repository https://github.com/moneytech/ncc. I examined that repository against my local copy of the defunct repository, and I determined that the original author added a lot of new commits on Jan. 1, 2019 onward. So I decided to upload my copy of ncc in its entirely with this README-FIRST. And it is a perfect excuse to learn how to upload a local repo to GitHub! :-)
