ANSI CONFORMANCE
================

for 100% ANSI compliance, the following need to be addressed. these 
are all really minor issues:

- wide character constants and string literals (*)

- trigraphs (*)

- disallow 'auto' storage class in function formal arguments

(*) = does anyone really care?


GENERAL
=======

- test suite

    framework is complete(-ish), but need to add test cases.
    the number of cases will ultimately be in the hundreds.

- archives

    need an 'ar'-style librarian and support for archive files in nld 


CODE GENERATION IMPROVEMENTS (ncc)
==================================

- register coalescing

    computations involving a temporary should compute directly into the target
    register when possible

- copy propagation
    
    registers that mirror other registers can be eliminated and replaced with
    the source registers. 

- fuse loads/stores for aliased variables in register allocator

    explicit loads or stores of aliased variables can be replaced with memory 
    operands (see rewrite() in gen.c)

- constant propagation

    registers with known constant values can be replaced with immediate operands

these last two but will require some means of determining which instructions 
allow which combinations of operands.

improving the compiler output wll be a never-ending task, but implementing these
changes will go a long way towards making the output "good enough" for now.
